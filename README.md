# content-based-movie-recommender
A content-based movie recommender system that suggests similar movies based on user-selected input. It uses natural language processing techniques such as TF-IDF and DistilBERT to analyze movie features like plot summaries, genres, and keywords. Built with Python and deployed using Streamlit for an interactive web experience.
ðŸ“Œ Overview

With the overwhelming number of movies released each year, finding a movie that suits your taste can be challenging. This recommendation system solves that problem by allowing users to select a movie and receive personalized recommendations based on the movie's content, not user ratings or popularity alone.

The system uses a combination of TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and DistilBERT embeddings to understand the semantic meaning of movie metadata and generate similarity scores using cosine similarity. It is deployed using Streamlit, offering an intuitive and interactive web interface.
